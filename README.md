# traffic_sign
this project is about creating a cnn model to predict traffic signs.Dataset used in this project is from kaggle.Model constricted in this project can classify upto 43 different traffic signs.
this project has two major section
## 1)interface : which demonstrate the use of model
## 2)modelling section : this section contains the code to prepare model. since the dataset contains 50000+ images so this section takes some time to execute.

<br>
interface.ipynb : this file contain the code for interface<br>
tsr_classifier.ipynb: this contains code for constructing the model.<br>

` these file can not execute in online ide because the data that is need is huge and cant be uploaded to a online ide `
